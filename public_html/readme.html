<h3>Test Data</h3>
I am entereing the test using the user tutorial below. Note that books have book ids for each copy and an ISBN can have many copies.
<br><br>
Lisa Simpson Card ID = 3141
Ralph's Card ID = 5555
Burn's Card ID = 9999
<br><br>
ISBN: 4701146064 has a Book Copy Id number 122 <br>
ISBN: 0060952822 has book id 123<br>
ISBN: 1608873203 has Book IDs 124 and 125<br>
ISBN: 1620402785 has Book IDs 126 and 127<br>
ISBN: 1932100709 has Book id 128<br>
<br><br>
Also, I have a lot of generated data from phase 2 left over so when searching the top n users who have lost books etc. You might need to search 50 or more to see ralph or m burns

<u>Adding Books</u>
<br>
When you add a book you first put in the info. Then to add copies you enter the isbn and number of copies. 
<br> Once completed you will be given the book id numbers that were added. 

<br>I am adding a page that will give you all book ids for a given isbn called Get Book Ids

<br>You will use these book ids to reserve or check out or check in a book
<br><br>
<u>To Join a waitlist.</u>
<br>
This is done by book id howvever book ids coorispond to a books isbn.
You may sign up to the waitlist for each book copy though. 
<br><br>
When a book copy is <u>Checked Out</u>, that book copy is marked as not available (0) <br> 
and once it is <u>Checked In </u> again that book copy is marked available with a (1)<br>
just becasue a book is available doesn't mean you are free to check it out, <br>
if there is a waiting list and you are not at the top of that list you must wait.

<br><br>

<u>Book Reviews</u> are done by Book ID
